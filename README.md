### Hi there 👋

I started my journey as a coder in August 2019, when I jumped into the pool of learning C at Hive Helsinki.<br><br>

Since that I have learned basic skills in
- C
- PHP
- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- MySql

as well as studied some UX/UI design and design thinking.<br>
I have found web development extremely fun and rewarding, and hoping that at my first internship position I can continue to develop my skills in the area.

Currently I'm working on enhancing my skills in PHP and JS through working on related school projects. At the moment I am building 'my own instagram'. Go check out the code I got so far from [here](https://github.com/cleisti/camigru)!

If you want to contact me, just send an email to camilla.leisti@gmail.com and I will get back to you ASAP! 🐯
