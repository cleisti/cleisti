### Hi there 👋

I started my journey as a coder in August 2019, when I jumped into the pool of learning C at Hive Helsinki.<br><br>

Since that I have learned basic skills in

- C
- PHP
- Javascript
  - React
  - Node
- Bash

- HTML5
- CSS

- MySql
- MongoDB

as well as studied some UX/UI design and design thinking.<br>
I have found web development extremely fun and rewarding, and hoping that at my first internship position I can continue to develop my skills in the area.

My latest project was to build an instagram/snapchat like web-app, where users can create and upload images. :camera_flash: Check it out [here](https://github.com/cleisti/camigru)!

My next project will be another web-app, this time a matchmaking tool like Tinder. For this project I have planned to use a PERN-stack, which will be all new to me.

If you want to contact me, just send an email to camilla.leisti@gmail.com and I will get back to you ASAP! 🐯
